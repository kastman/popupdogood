### Menu

Menu will feature a three-course selection of family-style meze,
hearty vegetable & kabob selections, and something sweet to finish.

Dishes are inspired by the intensely fragrant and colorful spices used in Syrian
cuisine. We will use this as our guide and take some playful twists along the
way. Please join us for delicious food and conversation, and make some friends
along the way. Pop UP and do good!
