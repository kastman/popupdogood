## Crisis in Syria

As chefs and cooks, we have the tremendous privilege of cooking for our
community in a restaurant setting. We have the blessing of quality ingredients
and an intrigued public who allow us to share our art with their support.
Through this abundance, however, there is real crisis. War torn Syria has forced
11 million to leave their homeland in search of security. Hunger is prevalent
and basic necessities are difficult to acquire. How can we help from so far
away?

An easy answer to a complicated question: Break bread. Gather around the table.
Share food inspired by the cuisine of Syria.

For one night, we will come together as family and open our hearts to those in
need. All proceeds from ticket sales will go directly to the American Refugee
Committee's efforts to provide food, clothing, hygiene kits, education and
emergency shelter for Syrian families fleeing violence.

All proceedsÂ from the event will be donated to the [American Refugee Committee's
effort](http://www.arcrelief.org/site/PageServer?pagename=programs_syria) to
provide refuge and shelter for people displaced in the current crisis in Syria
and Jordan.
