## The Chefs and Cooks

Mary Kastman and her cook pals from all around the city are executing this
event.  Mary moved to Boston in 2011 from the great state of Wisconsin (Go Pack,
Go!) and jumped right into eastern Mediterranean cuisine at Cambridge
Oleana restaurant. For three years she worked closely with Ana Sortun, Cassie
Piuma and Cara Chigazola learning the nuances of spice and the middle eastern
pantry. Currently, Mary continues to work with Piuma at Sarma enriching her
knowledge of eastern Mediterranean food. Most days you can find her in the heart
of the action at Sarma's Mezze bar.
